    title: "About Me"
    image: "/images/me.png"
    content: |-
      I am a PhD candidate at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, enrolled in the medicine and technology program. My research project focuses on developing data-driven approaches to achieve real-world evidence in various healthcare fields, including oncology, clinical trials design, emergency medicine, psychiatry care for children and adolescents, and health complex adaptive systems. 
      
      With a background in applied physics, I have previously worked on successfully developing deep learning and complex graph theory applications in neuroimaging. 

      In my spare time, I love exploring everything from tech and innovation to culture and history. It's important for me to keep a balanced lifestyle, which comes naturally thanks to my background as a high competitive sprint kayaker. My time on the water taught me discipline and helped me to win both national and international competitions.

          As a PhD student, I undertook departmental duties that included assistant teaching, supervising student projects, and providing consultancy to healthcare institutions involved in my research projects.
        
          I worked on two consultancies. One regarding emergency department and hospital overcrowding for the Akademiska sjukhuset hospital (Uppsala, Sweden), and the other regarding coordination of paediatric and adolescents psychiatric care units for the Stockholm region Barn och ungdomspsykiatri, BUP (Stockholm, Sweden).
        
          I did teaching classes for the courses on Statistics, Machine Learning, Simulation and Modelling, and Project Carrier Course.
        
          I was the main supervisor of nine thesis projects (four bachelor, and seven master students).

          During my master thesis, I learnt how utilise cloud parallel computing techniques at the Italian National Institute of nuclear Physics (INFN). 

          I used the resources of the data-centre "RECAS" (Bari, Italy) to analyse large MRI datasets, create complex brain structure graphs, and run deep learning algorithms for brain age prediction.

          My work lead to a scientific publication at the peer-reviewed journal Neuroimage (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811920309435)
